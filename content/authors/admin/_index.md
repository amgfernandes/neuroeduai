<p style="text-align: left;">

I am an experienced data scientist fascinated by the analysis of data, using AI/ML methods to gain valuable insights and improve decision-making. Aiming to empower people through knowledge!

Currently, I am using AI tools to help people get the best possible medical treatment.

In addition, I love communicating with diverse audiences, teaching, and to work in a team to solve complex problems. I am also a strong supporter of open-source tools, accessible to people around the world to tackle their challenges.
