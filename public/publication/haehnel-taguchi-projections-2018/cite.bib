 abstract = {Dopaminergic neurons of the descending diencephalospinal system are located in the posterior tuberculum (PT) in zebraﬁsh (Danio rerio), and correspond in mammals to the A11 group in hypothalamus and thalamus. In the larval zebraﬁsh, they are likely the only source of central dopaminergic projections to the periphery. Here, we characterized posterior tubercular dopaminergic ﬁbers projecting to peripheral sense organs, with a focus on the lateral line neuromasts. We labeled and identiﬁed catecholaminergic neurons and their projections by combining two immunoﬂuorescence techniques, (i) using an antibody against Tyrosine hydroxylase, and (ii) using an antibody against GFP in transgenic zebraﬁsh expressing in catecholaminergic neurons either membrane-anchored GFP to track ﬁbers, or a Synaptophysin-GFP fusion to visualize putative synapses. We applied the CLARITY method to 6 days old whole zebraﬁsh larvae to stain and analyze dopaminergic projections by confocal microscopy. We found that all lateral line neuromasts receive direct innervation by posterior tubercular dopaminergic neurons, and tracked these projections in detail. In addition, we found dopaminergic ﬁbers projecting to the anterior and posterior lateral line ganglia, and extensive central dopaminergic arborizations around the terminal projection ﬁeld of the lateral line afferent neurons in the hindbrain medial octavolateralis nucleus (MON). Therefore, dopaminergic innervation may affect lateral line sense information at different processing stages. Additional dopaminergic ﬁbers innervate the trigeminal ganglion, and we observed ﬁne catecholaminergic ﬁbers in the skin with arborization patterns similar to free sensory nerve endings. We also detected potentially dopaminergic ﬁbers innervating inner ear sensory epithelia. Therefore, the diencephalospinal A11-type dopaminergic system may broadly modulate peripheral senses. We also brieﬂy report peripheral sympathetic catecholaminergic projections labeled in our experiments, and their innervation of the developing intestine, swim bladder and abdominal organs.},
